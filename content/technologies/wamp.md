WAMP is a WebSocket protocol specified to offer routed RPC and PubSub. Its design goal is to provide an open standard for soft real-time message exchange between application components and ease the creation of loosely coupled architectures based on micro services. Because of this, it is a suitable enterprise service bus (ESB), fit for developing responsive Web applications or to coordinate multiple connected devices in the IoT.
