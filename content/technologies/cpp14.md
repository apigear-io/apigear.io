C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.

The C++ SDK uses `cmake` and the `conan` package manager to manage the build process. It defines a set of clean interfaces based on the ObjectAPI mapping. For testing `GoogleTest` is used.
