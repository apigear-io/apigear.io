  - title: Built-in data analytics
    text: >
      Dynamically configure the amount of data captured from the software solutions,
      while in development or deployed to the field.
      The captured data is highly structured captures the behavior of the product over time.
      This allows new businsfinding defacof any defects dramatically, there is no guessing anymore.
      The telemetry data can also be used afterAlso after the device is deployed our telemetry solution allows
      you optionally to trace the behavior of the device based in our data analytics solution.
