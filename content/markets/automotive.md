More than ever is software an essential ingredient in manufacturing a car. Sensors have to communicate with control units and the digital cockpit is more powerful and feature rich than ever. Creating all this software on different systems using different programming languages and technologies is a very complex tasks.

ApiGear allows the teams to take a step back from the complexity and focus on the overall interfaces of the individual software modules. They can come together and design the interfaces even before hardware is ready or the underlying communication protocol is decided.

The decoupling form hardware and software and the isolation of individual software modules is at the heart of ApiGear.
