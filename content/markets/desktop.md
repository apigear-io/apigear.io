Desktop software gets increasingly complex and requires often the integration of OS services and cloud services. Ensure your software modules are designed using interfaces. This allows you to split the work between teams easily and work in isolation on these modules. This lowers the team communication overhead but also later integration costs.

ApiGear allows you to define the different software modules internal and external to your application and to develop these in isolation.
