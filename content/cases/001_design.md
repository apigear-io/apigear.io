Designing your APIs using the ObjectAPI allows you to define clear boundaries for your software modules. Today often software APIs are written, not designed. Also if APIs reflect more and more business value for a product an API is often designed by one developer. 

Designing APIs means the team steps back from the technology and looks at the overall problem. Listens to all stakeholders and ensures all aspects are covered. Well designed APIs solve problems and encapsulates solutions.
