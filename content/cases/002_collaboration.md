Designing an API for object communication requires not only the service provider to define an API also the API consumers should ideally participate. Well designed APIs mirror the use cases of the API consumers.

Often APIs must reflect certain requirements defined in an overarching requirements document. For this domain owner have the knowledge and have deep insight into these requirements.

ApiGear allows all stakeholder to participate and review the API design and removes friction from the development process.
