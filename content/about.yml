      motivation: >
        Software programming has not changed much in the last 20 years since I started.
        We still type code into a window, we still rely on the wisdom of the talented,
        we still sit down for every new project and think how to start,
        we still try to figure out why integration is a mess,
        we still try to understand why productivity drops and the software gets overly complex.
        I believe we can do better.
